# Time Complexity Analysis in Code

Example code to demonstrate differences between time complexities.

## How to use

Install dependencies:

```shell
npm install
```

Start program:
```shell
npm start
```

## Counting steps

1. Initialize a new instance of the Counter class inside a function:
```javascript
const counter = new Counter();
```

1. For each step, call the increment function
```javascript
counter.inc();
```

1. Get the total count by using the total property
```javascript
const total = counter.total;
```
